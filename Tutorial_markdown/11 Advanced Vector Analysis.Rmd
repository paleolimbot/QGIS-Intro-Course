Go back to the [course outline](00_Course_outline.html) or the [geoprocessing](10_Interpolation_Contouring.html) tutorial.

## Purpose

* Use the "Join" feature to combine geographic information with census data.
* Use the *Select by expression* and attribute table sorting to examine spatial trends
* Apply a graduated layer style to visualize spatial trends.

## Assignment

The assignment for this module will be a map of population change in the HRM from 2006 to 2011.

## Tutorial

To start off, we need to add some data. The first layer will be the NS Census Tracts layer in the Advanced Vector Data folder.

![Slide01](11 Advanced Vector Analysis/Slide01.jpg)

Next you can optionally add a tile map backdrop to make sure the data is in the right place.

![Slide02](11 Advanced Vector Analysis/Slide02.jpg)

You will also have to set the projection (Remember! Always set the projection!). Set it to the "World Mercator" projection unless you have a reason to otherwise.

![Slide04](11 Advanced Vector Analysis/Slide04.jpg)

Let's start by examining the attribute table of the layer we've just added.

![Slide05](11 Advanced Vector Analysis/Slide05.jpg)

There isn't any census data! This is because there is so much census data that it couldn't possibly fit in one shapefile layer. Instead, it is kept in a separate table and **joined** to the shapefile using an identifier column.

![Slide06](11 Advanced Vector Analysis/Slide06.jpg)

### Joining Additional Data

To import this data, we will use the **Add Text Delimited Layer** dialog.

![Slide07](11 Advanced Vector Analysis/Slide07.jpg)

Choose *Browse* to select the file location.

![Slide08](11 Advanced Vector Analysis/Slide08.jpg)

Choose the "ns_2011.csv" file in the "Advanced Vector Data" folder.

![Slide09](11 Advanced Vector Analysis/Slide09.jpg)

There isn't any geometry in this table (no lat/lon), it's just an attribute table. As such, you'll need to tell QGIS no to assign a gometry.

![Slide10](11 Advanced Vector Analysis/Slide10.jpg)

Now we can see the attribute table in the *Layers* panel. It doesn't have geometry, but we can still view its contents by selecting *Open Attribute Table*.

![Slide11](11 Advanced Vector Analysis/Slide11.jpg)

Lo and behold, we have our data! I've selected a few columns from the large amount of available census data, including 2006-2011 population change, median age, population density, and total population.

![Slide12](11 Advanced Vector Analysis/Slide12.jpg)

To join this to our spatial data, we need to enter the *Layer Properties* dialog of the spatial layer.

![Slide13](11 Advanced Vector Analysis/Slide13.jpg)

Under the *Joins* tab, select the green "+" symbol.

![Slide14](11 Advanced Vector Analysis/Slide14.jpg)

The *Join layer* here is the ns_2011 table, the *Join field* is CT_name, and the *Target field* is CTNAME_NUM. These two columns are the columns that are the "ID" columns for the area that they represent.

![Slide15](11 Advanced Vector Analysis/Slide15.jpg)

Press *OK* to finalize the join.

![Slide16](11 Advanced Vector Analysis/Slide16.jpg)

Now, open the attribute table of the spatial layer.

![Slide17](11 Advanced Vector Analysis/Slide17.jpg)

You should see that the columns from the table have magically appeared under the spatial layer!

![Slide18](11 Advanced Vector Analysis/Slide18.jpg)

### Attribute Table Sorting

A simple way of spatial analysis is to sort the attribute table. Select a feature by clicking on the row number at the left. Which area has the highest population loss since 2006?

![Slide19](11 Advanced Vector Analysis/Slide19.jpg)

### Select By Expression

Attribute table sorting is good if there aren't many features or if you are only interested in extremes, but a more general-purpose tool is the *Select By Expressio...* dialog. You can find it under the *View* and *Select* menus.

![Slide20](11 Advanced Vector Analysis/Slide20.jpg)

The dialog that pops up is the *Expression editor*, which we have seen briefly before. Which census tracts are gaining population? Use the appropriate column and test `> 0`, and choose *Select* to find out.

![Slide21](11 Advanced Vector Analysis/Slide21.jpg)

To clear the selection, hit the clear selection button.

![Slide22](11 Advanced Vector Analysis/Slide22.jpg)

### Graduated Style

A way to visually look at high and low values of an attribute is to change the style according to the value of an attribute. To do this, open the *Layer Properties* dialog.

![Slide23](11 Advanced Vector Analysis/Slide23.jpg)

Next, choose a *Graduated* style.

![Slide24](11 Advanced Vector Analysis/Slide24.jpg)

Choose the population change column, and click *Classify*.

![Slide25](11 Advanced Vector Analysis/Slide25.jpg)

Press *OK*.

![Slide26](11 Advanced Vector Analysis/Slide26.jpg)

The polygons are now filled according to their population change values, but blue is not the best choice of colour scheme. Return to *Layer Properties*.

![Slide27](11 Advanced Vector Analysis/Slide27.jpg)

Among other things about the graduated style that we can change is the colour ramp. A good one for our puroses might be RdYGn, since red might naturally mean population loss, and green might naturally mean population gain.

![Slide28](11 Advanced Vector Analysis/Slide28.jpg)

Press *OK* to view the new colour scheme.

![Slide29](11 Advanced Vector Analysis/Slide29.jpg)

Most polygons are loosing population, so not all orange and red polygons represent places where people are moving out of. To fix this, we will revisit the *Layer Properties* dialog.

![Slide30](11 Advanced Vector Analysis/Slide30.jpg)

You can manually change the cut points between th classes, or you can use the *Histogram* to do it visually. Click the *Histogram* tab, then *Load values*.

![Slide31](11 Advanced Vector Analysis/Slide31.jpg)

Drag the vertical bars to adjust the cut points.

![Slide32](11 Advanced Vector Analysis/Slide32.jpg)

A good representation of the HRM would look something like this.

![Slide33](11 Advanced Vector Analysis/Slide33.jpg)

## The Assignment

The assignment for this module will be a map of population change in the HRM from 2006 to 2011. It should include some kind of basemap, a scalebar, and a legend.
